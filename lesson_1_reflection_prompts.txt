How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows me the changed section that is most likely to cause errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    I can see the progress of my thinking

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Pros: I get to commit between logical changes
    Cons: I might forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because programming files are connected

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    git log
    git diff id1 id2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    I can revert back and compare different versions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
